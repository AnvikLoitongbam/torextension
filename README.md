# torextension
A basic chrome web extension to make myself surfer 

This is for a final project for a course that i am taking ... what i am hopping to achieve through this project is the ability to make it harder to do pleasurable things. 
Often we impulsively go to websites like instagram and end up spending hours scrolling through the reels , i hate it , but i still do it. So here my line is logic is that if this things are harder to reach or use we will be discouraged from partaking in such activity . 
There was a video about this on yt about a guy  who wanted to learn to play the guitar , but he was getting addicted to the tv so he locked his tv basically making it harder to watch the tv and he put the guitar in the living room where it was easily reachable . and he 
would often find himself after work with nothing to do but his guitar , so he started playing it again.


Anyway i have no experience in web extenstion and please feel free to contribute . 


so what excatly do i want to do with this extension ? 
Blacklist certain websites eg social media websites , whenever the user visits this blacklisted website he will be redirected to another website ...well in this case i am going with a much more educational purpose so 
they will be redirected to websites that will make them solve maths , physics or even cs problems . the user will not be able to visit the blacklisted website if he/she did not solve these said problems !
Ofcouse we have to take the education level of the user into account to decide if it will be a hard problem or a relatively easy one or the sweet spot of middle. 


this is the scope of this project with 1 month left to submit my final project i should be able to achieve it .... maybe?
